          <p class="paragraph_block">One of my main ambitions in life is to
            travel and experience a widevariety of cultures around the world. It
            is so easy nowadays to go online and watch a video or read a blog
            about a hotspot for travelers and feel like you have been immersed.
            The reality is that what you may see there is not as glamorious as
            it is protrayed. Plus, there are places off the beaten path that are
            arguably more in tune with the cultures that raised them. I want to
            learn and understand the perspectives of those who have lived
            drastically different lives than me. I do not want to take the easy
            route by going to some stereotypical destination for any traveler. I
            am open to travel with company.
